            <h2>Introduction to Enaya's Project</h2>
            <p>Hey sweetheart..Today is valentines day and i hope to get this final draft to you before the day is over. i tried to think of what could be a meaningful gift to you. I thought about writing you a letter but my handwriting is absolute shit and that isn’t something I would really do. A typical person would buy you lots of expensive things but i wanted to be a bit more thoughtful and do something im almost positive no one else would ever do for you. thats how i came up with the idea to use my slightly flawed intelligence to build you a gift. I really hope you love this gift Although I wasn’t able to make it as extravagant as I wanted to because of the time constraints.
                <br />
                <br />Enjoy my darling

            <h2>Beginnings</h2>
            <p>I know you have heard me say this time and time again 
                but I promise I mean every word, I NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD BE HERE. you are by far the biggest surprise of the past 5 years and that’s no exaggeration. i can name more than 5 reasons why us having any type of dealings is the biggest taboo lol but im glad it has happened. The meanest little girl done turned sweet for me, a major plot twist if I were to say so myself. I spent lots of time 
                trying to figure you out even after I got the hint that you were interested. 
                Even to this day I sit and try to figure out my Enaya.</p>

            <h2>Valentines day gifts explained</h2>
            <p>I had thought about little things that can make us more intimate or help us understand each other more. I thought about different conversations that would open us up and connect us. I thought to our previous conversations which were very deep and I felt as if it wasn’t enough. I knew for a fact we were at a point that neither of us can deny and I knew I wanted to be closer to you. Thats when. The idea of little intimate things that can help us connect popped in my head. So during my valentines day shopping spree lol. I found things that were a gift for you but also a git for me, for us. And they will be explained in the following paragraphs</p>

            <h2>Closing remarks...</h2>
            <p>I appreciate you in many ways I can explain. although the words are hard to generate, I’ll to my best to present gestures and show you how much I love you throughout our journey. Anything I have said prior to today is 100% true. I see a future with us and I believe that we will build and grow to heights we haven’t imagined. 
                I can go all day and talk about how much I admire you but im going to wrap this up momentarily because I have to make sure you get this in a timely manner
                
                This is a brief ending to this site. I plan to continue building this as we progress as a unit. It will be more complex, bigger and more beautiful with every version that is created. I will do my best to portray my endless attraction, love, lust, happiness and gratefulness to you through this project.
                
                This site within itself is a gift but at the end you will notice a special part. Hopefully it can get through whatever you are going through. Whether it is with me or outside of me. Life waits on nobody and I know what its like to have a cloudy head with no real way to vent or organize your thoughts V2 coming soon darling
                
                Thankyou again</p>
