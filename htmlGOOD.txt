            <h2>Introduction to Enaya's Project</h2>
            <p>Hey sweetheart..Today is valentines day and i hope to get this final draft to you before the day is over. i have been working on this for a little bit but our current situation made me switch things up unfortunately
                I almost changed the project completely and i even had thought s of scrapping it but i want you to see my art. i tried to think of what could possibly be meaningful as a gift to to. obviously i thought about the normal things like buying you lots of expensive things but i wanted to be a bit more impressive and do something im almost positive no one else would do for you EVER.
                thats how i came up with the idea to use my part of the reason you loved me to build a gift for you. my knowledge. i had really high visions for this project but i settled beuase of the time constraints and the possibilty that we wont talk anymore. But enjoy my love!!!
